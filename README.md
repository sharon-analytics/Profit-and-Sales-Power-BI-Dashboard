##  Project Overview  

![Screenshot 2025-06-07 013125](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1adec35b-7e0d-4d08-ac8f-c87c4f88330b)


This report presents an executive summary of the financial performance for the year 2013/2014 using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal of the project was to analyze key business metrics—such as total sales, profits, profit percentage, and cost of goods sold (COGS), while breaking down performance across different countries, product segments, and time periods.

I designed this dashboard to provide stakeholders with a clear picture of where the business is doing well and where improvements are needed. It reflects my ability to structure raw data into meaningful insights that support decision-making at a strategic level.

##  Data Source  

The dataset used in this project is titled **“[Financial sample dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20635919/Financial.sample.dataset.xlsx)
”**, provided in Excel format. It includes transactional records for sales made across various countries and segments, covering details like product category, sale amount, profit, and shipping cost.

---

##  Tools Used  

- **Power BI**: For data modeling, cleaning (via Power Query), DAX calculations, and report visualization.

---

##  Data Preparation  

All cleaning and transformation were done in **Power Query** within Power BI. Key steps included:

- 🧹 Removed duplicates to maintain data accuracy  
- 🧾 Ensured consistency across country, segment, and product fields  
- 🕓 Converted and formatted date fields to enable monthly trend analysis  
- 🧮 Created calculated fields to derive **Total Profit** and **Profit %**  
- 💲 Verified currency formatting for financial metrics  

These steps helped ensure that the dashboard was built on reliable and structured data.

##  Analysis Objectives  

The following questions guided my analysis:  

- 🌍 Which countries are driving the most profit?  
- 🧱 How are different product segments performing in terms of sales and profitability?  
- 📉 Are there any products or segments with negative profit margins?  
- 📆 What patterns can we observe across time—monthly or quarterly?  
- 🎯 Where should efforts be focused to improve sales or reduce losses?

##  Summary of Findings  

**Key Metrics**  
- 💰 **Total Gross Sales:** $127.93M  
- 🟢 **Total Profit:** $16.89M  
- 📊 **Profit %:** 16.59%  
- 🧾 **Total COGS:** $101.83M  

**By Country**  
- 🇫🇷 France and 🇩🇪 Germany stood out as the most profitable markets  
- 🇲🇽 Mexico and 🇨🇦 Canada performed moderately, while 🇺🇸 the US showed the lowest profit figures  

**By Segment**  
- 👥 Consumer segment had the highest sales (44.22%), followed by Corporate (35.74%)  
- 🏠 Home Office accounted for the smallest share but still held notable sales value  

**By Product**  
- Some products contributed negatively to profit, likely due to high cost-to-revenue ratios. This presents an opportunity for product re-evaluation.

**Over Time**  
- 📈 Profit peaked in **December 2014** with over **$2M**  
- 📉 Lowest points were seen around **November 2013** and **May 2014**

##  Recommendations  

Based on my analysis, here are several recommendations I would make if I were presenting this to a business team:

1. **Country Focus**  
   - 🔍 Investigate what’s working well in France and Germany and consider applying those strategies in underperforming countries like the US and Canada  

2. **Segment & Product Evaluation**  
   - 🛒 Conduct a closer review of products with negative profit margins to determine whether cost reductions or pricing changes are feasible  

3. **Targeted Campaigns**  
   - 🗓 Leverage peak sales periods (especially in Q4) to run targeted marketing and inventory campaigns  
   - 🔎 Look into why sales dipped in certain months and address any underlying causes  

4. **Profit Optimization**  
   - 💡 Reassess pricing structures for high-cost products or underperforming categories

##  Final Thoughts  

This project was a great opportunity to deepen my experience with Power BI while applying my eye for structure and clarity. I enjoy breaking down messy or complex data into clean, actionable insights, and this dashboard reflects that.  

It also gave me the chance to apply design thinking and storytelling to data, which I believe is just as important as the numbers themselves. My goal is always to help businesses see their data clearly and act on it confidently.
